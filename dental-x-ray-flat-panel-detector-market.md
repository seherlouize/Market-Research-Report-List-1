<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dental X-Ray Flat Panel Detector Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Conversion</li><li>Indirect Conversion</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The dental X-ray flat panel detector market is primarily categorized into two types: direct conversion and indirect conversion. Direct conversion detectors utilize photoconductive materials that convert X-ray photons directly into electrical signals, offering high sensitivity and image quality. In contrast, indirect conversion detectors employ a two-step process where X-rays are first converted into visible light, which is then captured by a sensor to generate an image. Both types are pivotal in enhancing diagnostic capabilities in dental imaging.</p></p>
